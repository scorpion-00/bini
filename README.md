# Flask-MongoDB User Management API

This project is a Flask-based API for user management, using MongoDB as the database and Docker for containerization. It includes routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users. Passwords are securely hashed, and the API interacts with MongoDB for data storage. The application is set up and run using Docker for easy deployment.

## Features

- User creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD).
- Password hashing for security.
- MongoDB for data storage.
- Dockerized for easy setup and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.9

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/flask-mongo-api.git
   cd flask-mongo-api
   ```

2. Build and run the application with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the Flask app based on the Dockerfile.
   - Set up a MongoDB container to persist user data.

3. Access the API:

   The Flask API will be accessible at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. Verify MongoDB:

   MongoDB service will be running at:
   ```
   mongodb://localhost:27017/users_db
   ```

   You can verify the MongoDB setup using a MongoDB client or the Mongo shell.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for managing users:

- **Create a user (POST)**: `/users`
   - Payload: `{"id": "<id>", "name": "<name>", "email": "<email>", "password": "<password>"}`
- **Get all users (GET)**: `/users`
- **Get a user by ID (GET)**: `/users/<id>`
- **Update a user by ID (PUT)**: `/users/<id>`
   - Payload: Partial or complete update JSON
- **Delete a user by ID (DELETE)**: `/users/<id>`

## Docker Commands

- Build the Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t flask-mongo-api .
  ```

- Run the Docker container:

  ```bash
  docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-mongo-api
  ```

- Stop the containers:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

## Configuration

The configuration for MongoDB is set in `config.py` and can be modified via environment variables:

- `MONGO_URI`: The MongoDB URI (default is `mongodb://mongo:27017/users_db` in the Docker setup).

To change these, you can update the `docker-compose.yml` file or export environment variables before running the app:

```bash
export MONGO_URI=mongodb://<your-mongo-uri>
```

## Requirements

The dependencies for this project are listed in `requirements.txt`. The main dependencies include:
- Flask
- Flask-PyMongo
- Werkzeug
- Marshmallow
- Bson

To install them locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Locally (without Docker)

If you prefer to run the project without Docker:

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up MongoDB locally and update the `MONGO_URI` in `config.py`.

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
